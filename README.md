This is the `.vim/` directory. Create a symlink from this directory in your home `ln -s .vimrc ../.vimrc` and then install the plugins via vundle `vim +PluginInstall +qall`.

Also, I use iterm which is better for colors. That explains the `$ITERM_ENV` variable being set depending if it's in dark or light mode.
